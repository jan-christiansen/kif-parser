kif-parser
==========

:warning: This parser was designed to be used with the original
implementation of KIF (version 0.0.1). As the reimplementation of KIF
(version 1.0.0 and higher, also known as KIF-next) does not support
logging anymore, it does not work with the current version.

A converter that parses the output of KIF (Keep It Functional)
integration test logs and produces output in other formats, currently,
JUnit XML format, markdown, and JSON. The JUnit output can be used to
display a KIF test summary of on your Jenkins build server.

Usage
-----

Invoke

    kif-parser junit FILE

to convert a log file generated by KIF into JUnit XML format. Invoke

    kif-parser json FILE

to generate a JSON version of the KIF log file and

    kif-parser markdown FILE

for markdown output. You can use
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to generate other formats
like html or pdf from the markdown. For example, the following
command generates a pdf called `success.pdf` from the KIF log file
`test-files/success.log`.

    kif-parser markdown test-files/success.log | pandoc --toc -o success.pdf
